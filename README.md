# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game against another player locally in a web browser.

## How to Play:
1. **Setup**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Game Start**: Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your marker (X or O). Players take turns placing their markers until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
3. **Winning**: Achieve a row, column, or diagonal of three of your markers in a row to win the game.
4. **Draw**: If the entire grid is filled without a player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## File Structure:
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage, including the game grid and necessary elements for gameplay.
- **style.css**: Defines the visual styles of the game, including grid layout, cell styling, and overall appearance.
- **app.js**: JavaScript code for handling game logic and user interactions. It manages the placement of markers, checks for win/draw conditions, and updates the UI accordingly.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface adjusts to various screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Users can click on cells to place their markers, with the game updating in real-time to reflect the current state.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects winning combinations automatically and highlights the winning cells.
- **Restart Option**: After the game ends, players have the option to restart and play again.




## Future Improvements:
- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- **Scorekeeping**: Add functionality to keep track of wins, losses, and draws.
- **Customization**: Allow users to choose their marker symbols or customize the game's appearance.
